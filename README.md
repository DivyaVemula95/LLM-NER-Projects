# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT for Text Classification

The project uses the BERT-based dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english model for NER, applying it to the CoNLL-03 dataset to extract and classify entities like locations, persons, and miscellaneous entities. The entities are cleaned and displayed with their labels and confidence scores.
